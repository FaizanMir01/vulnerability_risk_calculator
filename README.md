# OWASP Risk Calculator

## Overview

The OWASP Risk Calculator is a web application designed to assess and calculate the overall risk of a system or application based on various factors related to threat agents, vulnerabilities, and their potential impact on technical and business aspects. The tool utilizes the OWASP Risk Formula, which combines Likelihood and Impact scores to provide an overall risk assessment.

## Features

- **Dynamic Chart Visualization:** The application dynamically visualizes the scores using a bar chart for Threat Agent, Vulnerability Factors, Technical Impact, and Business Impact.
- **Likelihood and Impact Scoring:** Users can input scores for various factors related to threat agents and vulnerabilities, and the application calculates Likelihood and Impact scores.
- **Overall Risk Calculation:** The application combines Likelihood and Impact scores to generate an overall risk score, providing a qualitative risk level (Note, Low, Medium, High, Critical).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS:** Structure and styling of the web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Implementation of dynamic behavior and calculations.
- **Bootstrap 4:** Front-end framework for responsive and visually appealing design.
- **Chart.js:** Library for creating interactive charts.
